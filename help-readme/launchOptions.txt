In Playwright, the launchOptions are configurations that you can pass when launching a browser instance. These options allow you to customize the behavior of the browser according to your requirements. Here are some commonly used launchOptions:

headless (boolean): Whether to run the browser in headless mode (true for headless, false for headed).
slowMo (number): Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. This is useful for debugging and observing the test execution.
args (string[]): Additional command-line arguments to pass to the browser instance.
executablePath (string): Path to the browser executable to use instead of the bundled one.
ignoreHTTPSErrors (boolean): Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation.
viewport (ViewportSize): Specifies the initial browser viewport size.
defaultViewport (ViewportSize): Specifies the default viewport size when the browser window is first opened.
userDataDir (string): Path to a user data directory to use for the browser instance.
channel (string): Channel to use for the browser instance (e.g., "chrome", "firefox", "webkit").
