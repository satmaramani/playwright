 the timezoneId option allows you to specify the timezone for the browser. This option is useful for testing applications that display time-sensitive information or behave differently based on the user's timezone. Here are some common scenarios and examples of how to use the timezoneId option:

Set Browser Timezone:

Set the timezone for the browser to a specific timezone identifier.

timezoneId: 'America/New_York'
Test Timezone-Sensitive Features:

Test features of your application that are sensitive to the user's timezone.

timezoneId: 'Europe/London'
Simulate User's Timezone:

Simulate the timezone of the end-user to verify that time-related features function correctly.

timezoneId: 'Asia/Tokyo'
Handle Daylight Saving Time (DST):

Test how your application handles transitions between standard time and daylight saving time.

timezoneId: 'America/Los_Angeles'
Verify Time Display Formats:

Verify that time display formats, such as 12-hour or 24-hour format, are correct for different timezones.

timezoneId: 'Australia/Sydney'
Test Scheduled Events:

Test scheduled events or reminders in your application across different timezones.

timezoneId: 'Asia/Kolkata'
Check Timezone-Dependent Behavior:

Check how your application behaves when users from different timezones interact with it.

timezoneId: 'Europe/Paris'
By using the timezoneId option, you can ensure that your tests accurately reflect the behavior of your application in different timezone environments.
