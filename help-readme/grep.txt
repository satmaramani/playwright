npx playwright test --grep "Addition"

npx playwright test --grep "calculations.spec.js"


Basic Usage: You can use --grep followed by a string to match against the descriptions or names of tests.

Example: --grep "login"

Regular Expressions: You can use regular expressions to match test descriptions or names.

Example: --grep "/login|signup/"

Case Insensitive Match: Use the i flag after the regular expression to perform a case-insensitive match.

Example: --grep "/login|signup/i"

Negation: Use ! to negate the match, meaning tests that don't match the pattern will be executed.

Example: --grep "!login"

Matching Test Files: You can also use --grep to match test filenames.

Example: --grep "login.spec"

Matching Entire Test Path: Match the entire test file path.

Example: --grep "/path/to/test/login.spec"

Matching Entire Test Path and Test Name: Match both the test file path and the test name.

Example: --grep "/path/to/test/login.spec::testLogin"

Excluding Specific Tests: Use ! to exclude specific tests from being executed.

Example: --grep "!login" --grep "signup"

Combining Multiple Patterns: You can combine multiple --grep options to filter tests based on multiple patterns.

Example: --grep "login" --grep "signup"
